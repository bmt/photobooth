= Photobooth Interface
This is a simple openframeworks-based UI.

== Building
=== Install XCode
If you don't already have xcode installed, it is available in the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

=== Run setup.sh
This will pull down openframeworks 0.8.4 and extract into a parent directory.

=== Build
Open pbInterface.xcodeproj in Xcode and build (cmd+B).  The built binary is used
by the embedded code, but it can also be run separately and controlled via
commands over stdin.
